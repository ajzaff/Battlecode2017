# Battlecode2017 (team #419)

The most interesting part of this repo are the scripts I developed to:

- automate A/B testing
- develop bots on git feature branches under `src/team419` then copy their code to `master` (this allowed me to merge code between feature branches rather than copy pasta, then later do A/B testing for all directories in `src`)

This code is CC.  Feel free to use any of it in this or any coming year of battlecode.
